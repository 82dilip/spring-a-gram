Spring-a-Gram is a demonstration of the Spring stack used to upload and view pictures.

Spring Data REST makes it incredibly simple to define and export data store entities. What does this mean?
You declare the POJOs that are stored in your database. You then define a related respository interface.
Spring Data REST takes it from there to create a hypermedia-driven, RESTful interface using Spring MVC
that lets you create, read, update, and delete data.

This sample application demonstrations how declaring a backend aimed at storing image data can make it
as simple as possible to upload pictures and then turn around and display them on a website. This opens
the door to other front ends, like an iOS or Android app.

Let's explore.

== Defining an item to store

`src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/springagram/Item.java`
[source,java]
----
package com.greglturnquist.springagram;

import org.springframework.hateoas.ResourceSupport;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Lob;

@Entity
public class Item {

	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
	private long id;
	
	private String name;

	@Lob
	private String image;

	....
}
----

The core piece of this app are the **Items**. It contains an auto-generated **id**, a **name**, and a raw **image** (stored in the format of a `String`).

NOTE: Java strings a wide and generally unicode based. To store the raw data of a picture in the database, it has been tagged with http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/Lob.html[@Lob],
an annotation used to signal this a **Large Object**.

== Create the simplest repository interface possible

`src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/springagram/ItemRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
package com.greglturnquist.springagram;

import org.springframework.data.repository.PagingAndSortingRepository;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.annotation.RepositoryRestResource;

@RepositoryRestResource()
public interface ItemRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository<Item, Long> {
}
----

All of the http://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data projects] are based on this similar concept: define an interface that extends either `CrudRepository` or `PagingAndSortingRepository` and then let Spring Data create a proxied concrete implementation. You get a handful of built in operations. You can add custom queries, but we aren't doing that right now.

This interface comes with an extra annotation: `RepositoryRestResource`. This annotation provides the means to change parts of the URLs and hypermedia, but we aren't using that here. 

NOTE: If you notice the end of the declaration where it says `<Item, Long>`, that indicates the entity type and the type of its keys.

== Spinning up a RESTful server app

One last piece remains.

`src/main/java/com/greglturnquist/springagram/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
package com.greglturnquist.springagram;

import java.io.IOException;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Import;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.config.EnableJpaRepositories;
import org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.config.RepositoryRestMvcConfiguration;

@Configuration
@EnableJpaRepositories
@Import(RepositoryRestMvcConfiguration.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}
}
----

This is mostly boilerplate. It contains key annotations to declare and launch an application.

* @Configuration means this class is the source of beans for a Spring app
* @EnableJpaRepositories turns on the ability to scan and detect JPA entities and repository interfaces
* @Import(RepositoryRestMvcConfiguration.class) pulls in a handful of beans needed to launch Spring Data REST, which is really a specialized Spring MVC app
* @EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to autoconfigure as much as possible
* @ComponentScan tells Spring to look for any other classes in the same package that are configurable, such as @Component's, @Service's, and @Controller's

This code, by itself, it enough to spin up a http://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-rest/[RESTful, hypermedia based] app. There is no visual element here. You only have access to tools like **curl** or whatever REST client you wish to use. But you can perform all the CRUD operations you want.

At the root, you can see what links are available.
```
$ curl localhost:8080
{
  "_links" : {
    "items" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/items{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    },
    "jsclient" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/jsclient"
    }
  }
}
```

* /items is where individual items are stored.
* /jsclient is a collection of prebuilt Javascript libraries designed to speed up building a rich front end.

```
$ curl localhost:8080/items
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/items{?page,size,sort}",
      "templated" : true
    }
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 0,
    "totalPages" : 0,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
```

Here you can see there are no entries yet.

== Building a rich front end

To dial up the visual appeal and show easy Spring Data REST makes it to build your own picture sharing service, I added a web page.

It's pretty simple. It contains a form where you can pick a picture and submit it for upload. Following that is a table to display a thumbnail-sized version of each picture.

* This app is using webjars to fetch a copy of http://jquery.com[jQuery]
* This app also uses Spring Data REST's https://github.com/gregturn/spring-data-rest/tree/dynamic-javascript[experimental dynamic javascript library], provided directly from `/jsclient/jquery`.

In encourage you to skim through all the code to see how it readily demonstrates the power and simplicity of having a complete, RESTful service.
